Class Compatibility:-
		A class behaviourlly compatbil only if it supports all operations of other classes. This class is called sub-type. Derived class are sub-type of the base class.
		Base class can be replace by its sub-type classes. It can support all legal messages (stimulis) of the base class.
6.2-) Polymorphism:-
			In general polymorphism, "an entity can exist in different forms.". i.e diamond and carbon are different form of carbon.
			While in OO model polymorphism, " an object (entity) can behave in different ways for the same message". Consequently,
			sender of the message doesn't need to know the exact class of the reciever. Sender send message to the reciever and appropriate method called on the reciever.
